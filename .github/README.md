# Content-HelperBot

### Motivation 
It's normal for a person to be curious about someone's opinion, especially about a topic, but if this person's idea has spread to hundreds of videos, it becomes difficult to find what they are looking for. This bot uses the word you give to offer you that person's ideas on this topic.

### Overview
A DiscordJS Bot that offers you timestamps based on the given word and allows you to choose one of them. According to the selected timestamp, it gives a youtube link starting from the point where the timestamp is located. The bot is currently working only for a youtube channel.

The owner of all videos and data is ArmaÄŸan Amcalar. [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ArmaganAmcalar)

A website Which allows you to search more widely and freely between videos. [Website](https://content-searcher-beta-umbwiyhqiq-no.a.run.app/)
